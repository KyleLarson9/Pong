Description

This project demonstrates a simple AI for the classic game Pong. The AI utilizes kinematics equations to predict the ball trajectory.

Features

  1. Kinematics Physics: The AI uses kinematics equations to accurately predict the ball's movement.
  2. Data Storage: An array list of Points (a class in Java) stores critical points for the AI to make decisions.
  3. Java Swing: Used to develop the Graphical User Interface and game components.

Why I Developed the Project

I am interested in the integration of physics and computer science and am currently studying both fields in school. My hope for this project was to create an interesting way to meld simple physics and a data structure of my choosing into something with a visual aspect.

What I Learned

In this project, I learned more about the array list data structure, how to add data, remove data, and access the data as well as a better understanding of good coding practices in Object Oriented Programming.
